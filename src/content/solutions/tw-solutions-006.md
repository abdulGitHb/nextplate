heading: "International Flexibility"

content: "Most recruiters have experienced the pain of finding the perfect candidate for a role, only to turn them down because of the country where they reside. Employers of record(EOR) provide the solution to this problem. They can employ workers in other countries on your behalf, and you don’t have to open your own entity in that country. It acts as the legal employer of your workers on paper.
Companies choose to partner with PEOs when they want to streamline their HR operations, save time on administrative tasks, and provide better benefits to their employees.
If you’re a small or medium-sized business owner that needs HR help, Our PEO is definitely worth considering. But if you want to expand your business internationally, Our EOR may give you more flexibility."
